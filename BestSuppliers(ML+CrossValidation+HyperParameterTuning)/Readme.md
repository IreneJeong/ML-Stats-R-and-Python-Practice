This report discusses the use of machine learning (ML) models in recommending the best suppliers to Acme Corporation, </br>
given a set of task features. This process begins with data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA) </br>
and machine learning(Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet were used to and compared), <br>
where results from predicted data can be obtained. Cross-validation (Leave-One-Group-Out) is used </br>
to validate the ML model score, and hyper-parameter optimization is further used to find the optimal set of hyper-parameters for improved predictions.</br>
